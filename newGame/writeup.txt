	This is the first day that I start my project!
	I first created a world, where we defined our borders
	I then imported a sprite sheet split of the animations as well as created the animations
	I got a little bit ahead by creating the animations, but i think they look cool!
	I learned quite a bit about movement using vectors in game development:
		Think about a graph: 
			Right = (1,0), Left = (-1,0)

	Today I added a more natural feel to the movements by adding:
		Friction
		Acceleration
		Max speed
	There was an issue with the speed multiplying when moving diagonally:
		This was fixed by implementing normalization:
			The vector is capped, it used to go beyond our x,y coordinates
			using normalization our point is set to the max of our x,y coordinate
		
	I added collisions, very easy
	
	Added bush collisions using capsule boxes
	created bush scene then inserted bush
	y-sort so player stays on top of bush until behind
	
	ANIMATION TREES!
